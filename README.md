# Reflex-wx

Reflex-wx is my implementation of [reflex](https://github.com/ryantrinkle/reflex). It is still very much a work in progress, though it is getting close to a stable release. 

Right now, I have three main things left:
* Integrate layout constructions in an elegant fashion--this is probably the most important thing since once I have this worked out, the library will, for all intents and purposes, be fully functional
* Work out some kinks with properties and their integration into reflex. For instance, the /text/ attribute is a nightmare.
* Performance increases, bug fixes, and lots and lots of testing! :D
